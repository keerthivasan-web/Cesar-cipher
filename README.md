# Cesar-cipher
The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in a plaintext message is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. To decrypt, the process is reversed, shifting the letters back by the same amount.
